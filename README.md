# Reach to You — a dreamy pink gimmick site

Welcome to the pastel world of **Reach to You**, a cute little gimmick site made for my song!

This is a soft, dreamy, social-media-style page that shows a fictional celebrity crush’s “profile” and sweet little updates. Floaty sparkles, soft fonts, and a heart-thoughts aesthetic all around.

## Features
- Pastel pink + dreamy layout
- “Fake feed” of social media crush posts
- Mobile-friendly design
- Floating sparkles & hearts
- Audio player for my song

## How to Customize
- Upload your crush photo as `crush.png`
- Upload your song as `your-song.mp3`
- Edit `index.html` to add more fake posts!
